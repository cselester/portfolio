          <h3>Custovista : AI-Powered Customer Insights<a
              href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/cselester/Custovista/tree/main"><span
                class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a></h3>
          <p>
            Custovista is an interactive AI-powered application built on Hugging Face Spaces that enables businesses to
            gain
            real-time customer insights from their data. The project leverages multi-modal agentic AI and
            visualization techniques to analyze customer interactions, detect sentiment, and highlight emerging trends.

            The goal behind Custovista was to create a lightweight yet powerful tool for organizations that want to
            understand customer behavior without investing in complex enterprise solutions. With its simple interface
            and intuitive visualizations, Custovista makes it easier for teams to track satisfaction levels, identify
            pain points, and make data-driven decisions.

            By combining accessibility, explainability, and scalability, the project demonstrates how multi-modal AI
            can be democratized for customer analytics, empowering businesses of all sizes to act on customer feedback
            effectively.

          <h3>FraudGuard : Fraud Stops Here <a href="https://github.com/cselester/fraudguard"><span
                class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a></h3>
          <p>
            During HackHound 3.0, a 24-hour offline hackathon held at SRM-NCR Campus, I developed a lightweight fraud
            detection system aimed at addressing the growing issue of digital fraud. The motivation stemmed from the
            observation that most existing fraud detection systems are either too complex or financially inaccessible,
            especially for small businesses and startups.

            While larger organizations may have the resources to deploy advanced AI-based security solutions, smaller
            players often lack the infrastructure or technical expertise to do the same. Our solution was designed to be
            simple, fast, and easy to integrate, offering real-time detection of suspicious transactions without the
            overhead of large-scale systems.

            By focusing on accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, our product empowers small enterprises to
            take the first step toward securing their digital operations with AI-driven insights.

          <h3>Box Office Data Prediction<a
              href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nuBZFVcPHyqJ1Of-UC9ExVHHruHK4dSg/view?usp=sharing"><span
                class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a></h3>
          <p>
            During my IBM Externship, I undertook a project focused on
            predicting box office data using Python libraries such as pandas,
            matplotlib, and scikit-learn. With my intermediate level web
            development and software development skills, I built a predictive
            model that leveraged data science and machine learning techniques.
            Alongside my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, I
            utilized Python programming to analyze and process the box office
            dataset. This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of
            data science concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios,
            demonstrating my proficiency in Python, data manipulation with
            pandas, data visualization with matplotlib, and machine learning
            with scikit-learn.

          <h3>Study Center Management<a href="https://github.com/cselester/studycenter"><span
                class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_outward</span></a></h3>
          <p>
            For my college project, I developed a study center management
            website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This
            comprehensive website aimed to streamline the management of a
            study center by providing features such as student enrollment,
            course management, attendance tracking, and exam scheduling.
            Through HTML and CSS, I created an intuitive and visually
            appealing user interface. JavaScript was used to add interactivity
            and enhance user experience. PHP and MySQL were employed for
            server-side scripting and database management, respectively. This
            project showcased my proficiency in front-end and back-end web
            development, database integration, and problem-solving skills.
